# Attribute Combine Vector SOP
Houdini HDA that combines vector attributes using vector-specific operations, such as :
- Cross product
- Vector projection
- Vector rotation

Blending between results can be done with spherical interpolation, which was added in Houdini 20.0

Check the HDA's help card as well as the examples hip file to learn basics and see how to use it with a couple of workflows.
